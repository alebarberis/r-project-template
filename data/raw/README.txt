This folder contains the raw data used in the project.

This folder should be organised per data source, meaning that each data source should have its own subfolder.

Inside each data source folder there should be two directories:

1) code: The code directory should contain the code used to download or pre-process the raw data.
2) data: The data directory should contain the actual raw data.
